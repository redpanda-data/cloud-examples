# The employee (or automated tooling) that will be responsible for running `rpk cloud byoc aws apply|destroy` is
# referred to as the "RPK User". The policies defined in this file are provided for documentation purposes only.
# You may grant your "RPK User" these actions in any way you wish in accordance with the norms of your organization.
#
# The RPK User must have a minimum set of permissions for creating|destroying the Redpanda Agent VM. Once the VM is
# created it will handle the remaining provisioning using the permissions granted in iam_redpanda_agent.tf.
#
# In addition to provisioning the Redpanda Agent VM some validation is performed by `rpk cloud byoc aws apply`. The
# goal of the validation logic is to verify that the customer provided resources have been configured correctly (e.g.
# is the redpanda agent granted the necessary actions? On the appropriate resources? Is the CIDR range sufficient?)
# So that these validations may be performed certain read actions are also suggested for the RPK User.
