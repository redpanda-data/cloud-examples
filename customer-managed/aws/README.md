# Overview

This repository contains [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) code that describes the resources
customers are responsible for creating in association with a Redpanda customer-managed VPC cluster. These resources
should be created in advance by the customer and then provided to Redpanda during cluster creation.

> There may be resources in this repository that already exist within your environment (for example, the VPC) that you 
> don't want to create. Variables are provided for this purpose.

> This code is provided as examples and should be reviewed to ensure it adheres to policies within your organization.

# Prerequisites

1. Access to an AWS project where you want to create your cluster
2. Knowledge of your internal VPC and subnet configuration (for example, the ARN of the VPC and private subnets)
3. Permission to create, modify, and delete the resources described by this Terraform
4. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) version 1.8.5 or later

# Setup

> You may want to configure [remote state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/remote) for this 
> Terraform. For simplicity, these instructions assume local state.

## Configure the variables

The [variables.tf]() file contains a number of variables that allow you to modify this code to meet your specific needs.
In some cases, they let you skip creation of certain resources (for example, the VPC) or modify the configuration of a
resource.

Create a JSON file called `byoc.auto.tfvars.json` inside the Terraform directory.

## Initialize the Terraform

Initialize the working directory containing Terraform configuration files.

```shell
terraform init
```

## Apply the Terraform

```shell
terraform apply
```

## Capture the output

The output of `terraform apply` should display a number of output values. For example:

```shell
agent_instance_profile_arn = "..."
byovpc_rpk_user_policy_arns = "[...]"
cloud_storage_bucket_arn = "..."
cluster_security_group_arn = "..."
connectors_node_group_instance_profile_arn = "..."
connectors_security_group_arn = "..."
dynamodb_table_arn = "..."
k8s_cluster_role_arn = "..."
management_bucket_arn = "..."
node_security_group_arn = "..."
permissions_boundary_policy_arn = "..."
private_subnet_ids = "[...]"
redpanda_agent_role_arn = "..."
redpanda_agent_security_group_arn = "..."
redpanda_node_group_instance_profile_arn = "..."
redpanda_node_group_security_group_arn = "..."
utility_node_group_instance_profile_arn = "..."
utility_security_group_arn = "..."
vpc_arn = "..."
```

These values can also be retrieved at any time by running `terraform output`.

Note these values. They are needed for the next steps. To continue with cluster creation, see 
[Create a BYOVPC Cluster on AWS](https://docs.redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud/get-started/cluster-types/byoc/aws/vpc-byo-aws/).
